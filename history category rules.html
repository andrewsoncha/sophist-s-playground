									<h3>About</h3>
									<p>In the history category, two historic events far apart from each other in terms of time will be announced. Participants will be asked to provide a reasoning to claim that one event is the cause of the other (For example: “Prove that the black death is the cause of the Cuban Missile Crisis”). </p>

									<h3>Outside Sources</h3>
									<p>Participants are not allowed to use any outside resources to back their claims other than Wikipedia. In other words, when describing a historical event, era, location, or person, the description must come from Wikipedia and the appropriate Wikipedia article must be linked in the “Reference” part of the proof. This is done to limit the source of information participants can reference and prevent instances where historical sources with conflicting claims are presented. The choice of using Wikipedia as the source is not because it provides credible and accurate historical knowledge, but because of the sheer volume of the articles and the variety of the topics, allowing participants to link events or information that might be seemingly unrelated to the presented two events.</p>

									<h3>Winner Selection</h3>
									<p>The submitted proofs will be ranked in their creativity. Please note that if a proof does not reference their sources properly or makes a leap of logic that is not explained thoroughly, the proofs may be disqualified. The participants who submitted the top-ranking proofs will be given the appropriate prizes.</p>
								
									<h3>Submission Form</h3>
									<p>Participants are to submit their proofs in the form of a word document. We highly recommend participants to read some of the <a href="example proofs.html">example proofs</a> to get a sense of how to write and format their proofs. </p>
